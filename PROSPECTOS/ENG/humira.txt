What Humira is and what it is used for

Humira contains the active substance adalimumab.
Humira is used to treat
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
• Enthesitis-related arthritis
• Ankylosing spondylitis
• Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis
• Psoriatic arthritis
• Plaque psoriasis
• Hidradenitis suppurativa
• Crohn’s disease
• Ulcerative colitis
• Non-infectious uveitis
The active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies
are proteins that attach to a specific target.
The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the
immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By
attaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.
Humira is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given other
disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these
medicines, you will be given Humira.
Humira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous
methotrexate treatment.
Humira can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help them
move more freely.
Your doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone.
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.
Humira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years of age. You may
first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well
enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira.
Your doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone.
Enthesitis-related arthritis
Enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where tendons join the
bone.
Humira is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years of age. You may first be given
other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these
medicines, you will be given Humira.
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing
spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing
spondylitis are inflammatory diseases of the spine.
Humira is used to treat severe ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic
evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not
respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira.
Psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that is usually associated with psoriasis.

Humira is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Humira can slow down the damage to the joints caused
by the disease and can help them move more freely. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not
respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira.
Plaque psoriasis
Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery
scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift
away from the nail bed which can be painful.
Humira is used to treat
• moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults and
• severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable.
Hidradenitis suppurativa
Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin
disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most
commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.
Humira is used to treat
• moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and
• moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.
Humira can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often
associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to
these medicines, you will be given Humira.
Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.
Humira is used to treat
• moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in adults and
• moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years
You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will
be given Humira.
Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine.
Humira is used to treat
• moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and
• moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.

You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will
be given Humira.
Non-infectious uveitis
Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.
Humira is used to treat
• adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye
• children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the
front of the eye
This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots
or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation.
You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will
be given Humira.
2.

What you need to know before you use Humira

Do not use Humira:
•

If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section
6).

•

If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is
important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever,
wounds, feeling tired, dental problems.

•

If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or
have a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira.
Allergic reactions
•

If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling
or rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these
reactions can be life threatening.

Infections
•

If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for
example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your
doctor.

•

You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may
increase if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include:
• tuberculosis
• infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria
• severe infection in the blood (sepsis)
In rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get
symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to
stop using Humira for some time.

•

Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example,
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common.

•

Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that
increase the risk of infections.

•

If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and
your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with
Humira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever,
wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.

Tuberculosis
•

It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have
been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do
not use Humira.
•

•
•

As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor
will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will
include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate
screening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results
of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.
Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the
prevention of tuberculosis.
If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack
of energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your
doctor immediately.

Hepatitis B
•

Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if
you think you might be at risk of getting HBV.
• Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the
virus to become active again.
• In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune
system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.

Surgery or dental procedure

•

If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are
taking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.

Demyelinating disease
•

If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around
the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue
to receive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in
your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.

Vaccinations
•

Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.
•
•
•

Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.
It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for
their age before they start treatment with Humira.
If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for
getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose
you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other
health care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can
decide when your baby should receive any vaccine.

Heart failure
•

If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be
closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a
serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g.
shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your
doctor will decide if you should receive Humira.

Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale
In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off
infections or help you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you
develop a fever that does not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look
very pale, call your doctor right away.

•

Cancer
•

There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking
Humira or other TNF blockers.
•
•

People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time
may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph
system) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).
If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may
increase. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen
in patients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or
6-mercaptopurine.

•
•
•
•

Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.
Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.
If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change
appearance, tell your doctor.

There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung
disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF
blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether
treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.

Autoimmune disease
•

On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your
doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.

Children and adolescents
•

Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira.

Other medicines and Humira
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
You should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased
risk of serious infection:
• anakinra
• abatacept.
Humira can be taken together with:
• methotrexate
• certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine,
leflunomide and injectable gold preparations)
• steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
If you have questions, please ask your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
•
•
•
•
•
•

You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use
for at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment.
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor
for advice about taking this medicine.
Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.
According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had
received Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not
receive Humira.
Humira can be used during breast-feeding.
If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an
infection.

•

It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your
Humira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information
on vaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section.

Driving and using machines
Humira may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning sensation
and vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira.
