Patient Information
DUPIXENT® (DU-pix-ent) (dupilumab) injection,
for subcutaneous use
What is DUPIXENT?
DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:
⚬ to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well
controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with
or without topical corticosteroids.
⚬ with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma in adults and children 6 years of age
and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks
(exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need
while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing.
⚬ with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children
12 years of age and older whose disease is not controlled.
⚬ to treat adults and children 1 year of age and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), who weigh at least 33 pounds (15 kg).
⚬ to treat adults with prurigo nodularis (PN).
⚬ with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and a high number of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that may contribute to your COPD). DUPIXENT is
used to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days) and can improve your
breathing.
• DUPIXENT is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace an inhaled rescue medicine.
