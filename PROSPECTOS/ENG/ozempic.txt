1.

What Ozempic® is and what it is used for

Ozempic® contains the active substance semaglutide. It helps your body reduce your blood sugar level
only when blood sugar is too high and can help prevent heart disease.
Ozempic® is used to treat adults (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise
is not enough:
•
on its own – when you cannot use metformin (another diabetes medicine) or
•
with other medicines for diabetes – when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels.
These may be medicines you take by mouth or inject such as insulin.
It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as told by your doctor, pharmacist or
nurse.
2.

What you need to know before you use Ozempic®

Do not use Ozempic®
•
if you are allergic to semaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.
This medicine is not the same as insulin and you should not use it if:
•
you have type 1 diabetes – a condition where your body does not produce any insulin
•
you develop diabetic ketoacidosis – a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, breathing
difficulty, confusion, excessive thirst, a sweet smell to the breath or a sweet or metallic taste in
the mouth.
Ozempic® is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin.

If you know that you are due to have surgery where you will be under anaesthesia (sleeping), please
tell your doctor that you are taking Ozempic®.
Effects on the digestive system
During treatment with this medicine, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have
diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you drink
plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney problems. Talk
to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.
Severe and on-going stomach pain which could be due to acute pancreatitis
If you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area – see a doctor straight away as this could be
a sign of acute pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of inflamed
pancreas.
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)
Combining a sulfonylurea or an insulin with this medicine might increase the risk of getting low blood
sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar levels.
Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help your doctor decide if the dose
of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low blood sugar.
Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy)
If you have diabetic eye disease and are using insulin, this medicine may lead to a worsening of your
vision, and this may require treatment. Tell your doctor if you have diabetic eye disease or if you
experience eye problems during treatment with this medicine. In case you have potentially unstable
diabetic eye disease, it is not recommended that you use Ozempic® 2 mg.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents aged under 18 years as the safety and
efficacy in this age group have not yet been established.
Other medicines and Ozempic®
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing any of the
following:
•
Warfarin or other similar medicines taken by mouth to reduce blood clotting (oral anticoagulants). You may need frequent blood tests to check how quickly your blood clots.
•
If you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will
recommend you to monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid hyperglycaemia
(high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the
body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it affects an unborn baby.
Therefore, use of contraception is recommended while using this medicine. If you wish to become
pregnant, discuss how to change your treatment with your doctor as you should stop using this

medicine at least 2 months in advance. If you become pregnant while using this medicine, talk to your
doctor right away, as your treatment will need to be changed.
Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Ozempic® is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you use this medicine in
combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may
reduce your ability to concentrate. Do not drive or use machines if you get any signs of low blood
sugar. See section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for information on increased risk of low blood sugar
and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.
Sodium content
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodiumfree’.

Tear off the paper tab.

C

Make sure to attach the needle correctly.

D

Push the needle straight onto the pen.
Turn until it is on tight.
The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove
both caps. If you forget to remove both caps, you will
not inject any solution.

Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You
will need it after the injection, to safely remove the
needle from the pen.
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you
try to put it back on, you may accidentally stick yourself
with the needle.

E

F

A drop of solution may appear at the needle tip. This is normal,
but you must still check the flow, if you use a new pen for the
first time. See step 2 ‘Check the flow with each new pen’.
Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to
take your injection.
Always use a new needle for each injection.
This may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection and inaccurate dosing.
Never use a bent or damaged needle.
2. Check the flow with each new pen
•
If your pen is already in use, go to step 3 ‘Select your
A
dose’. Only check the flow before your first injection
with each new pen.

B

A small drop may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected.

If no drop appears, repeat step 2 ‘Check the flow with each new pen’ up to 6 times. If there is still no drop,
change the needle and repeat step 2 ‘Check the flow with each new pen’ once more.
Dispose of the pen and use a new one if a drop of solution still does not appear.
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you use a new pen for the first time.
This makes sure that the solution flows.
If no drop appears, you will not inject any medicine even though the dose counter may move. This
may indicate a blocked or damaged needle.
If you do not check the flow before your first injection with each new pen, you may not get the
prescribed dose and the intended effect of Ozempic®.

You may see a drop of solution at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your
dose.
Always watch the dose counter to know how many mg you inject. Hold the dose button down
until the dose counter returns to ‘0’.
How to identify a blocked or damaged needle
– If ‘0’ does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, you may
have used a blocked or damaged needle.

from the original dose that you have set.
How to handle a blocked needle
Change the needle as described in step 5 ‘After your injection’ and repeat all steps starting with step 1
‘Prepare your pen with a new needle’. Make sure you select the full dose you need.
Never touch the dose counter when you inject. This can interrupt the injection.
