What Biktarvy is and what it is used for

Biktarvy contains three active substances:
bictegravir, an antiretroviral medicine known as an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)
emtricitabine, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (NRTI)
tenofovir alafenamide, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleotide reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI)
Biktarvy is a single tablet for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in
adults, adolescents and children 2 years of age and older, who weigh at least 14 kg.
Biktarvy reduces the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your immune system and reduce the
risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Biktarvy:
-

If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients with liver
disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk
of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have hepatitis B infection, your doctor
will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you.

-

If you have hepatitis B infection. Liver problems may become worse after you stop taking
Biktarvy.
Do not stop taking Biktarvy if you have hepatitis B. Talk to your doctor first. For more details, see
section 3, Do not stop taking Biktarvy.

→

-

If you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys. Your
doctor may order blood tests to monitor how your kidneys work when starting and during treatment
with Biktarvy

While you are taking Biktarvy
Once you start taking Biktarvy, look out for:
-

Signs of inflammation or infection
Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems

→

If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately. For more information see
section 4, Possible side effects.

There is a possibility that you may experience kidney problems when taking Biktarvy over a long period
of time (see Warnings and precautions).
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Biktarvy you may still develop infections or
other illnesses associated with HIV infection.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years of age, or weighing less than 14 kg regardless of
age. The use of Biktarvy in children under 2 years of age, or weighing less than 14 kg has not yet been
studied. For children and adolescents who weigh 25 kg or more, Biktarvy 50 mg/200 mg/25 mg filmcoated tablets are available.

9S071

Loss of bone mass has been reported in some children from 3 to less than 12 years of age who received
one of the active substances (tenofovir alafenamide) contained in Biktarvy. The effects on long term bone
health and future fracture risk in children is uncertain. Your doctor will monitor your child’s bone health
as needed.
Other medicines and Biktarvy
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. Biktarvy may interact with other medicines. As a result, the amounts of Biktarvy or other
medicines in your blood may change. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may
make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your
blood levels.
Medicines that must never be taken with Biktarvy:
rifampicin used to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety, or
products that contain it.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
•
•
•
•

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant and ask about the potential benefits and risks of
your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child.
Antacids and supplements containing aluminium and/or magnesium: during your pregnancy you
will need to take Biktarvy at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking antacids, medicines or
supplements containing aluminium and/or magnesium.
Supplements or medicines containing calcium and/or iron: during your pregnancy you will need
to take Biktarvy at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking supplements or medicines containing
calcium and/or iron. Alternatively, you can take them together with food at any time.

If you have taken Biktarvy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other
diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV
outweighed the risk of side effects.
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Biktarvy. This is because some of the active substances in
this medicine pass into human breast milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with
HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or
thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Biktarvy can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy when taking Biktarvy, do not drive or ride a bicycle and
do not use any tools or machines.
Biktarvy contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.

How to take Biktarvy

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if
you are not sure.
There are two strengths of Biktarvy tablets. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate tablet for your age
and weight.
The recommended dose is:
Children 2 years of age and older, who weigh at least 14 kg but less than 25 kg: one tablet each day
with or without food (one 30 mg/120 mg/15 mg tablet).

9S071

Due to the bitter taste, it is recommended not to chew or crush the tablet.
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, you can split it in half. Take both halves of the tablet
one after the other to get the full dose. Do not store the split tablet.
The score line on the tablet is only there to help you break the tablet if your child has difficulty
swallowing it whole.
The 90-day multipack contains three 30-day packs together.

Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:
antacids to treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, or acid reflux, containing aluminium and/or
magnesium hydroxide
•
mineral supplements or vitamins containing magnesium or iron
→
See section 2 for more information on taking these medicines with Biktarvy.
•

If you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Biktarvy following completion of dialysis.
If you take more Biktarvy than you should
If you take more than the recommended dose of Biktarvy you may be at higher risk of side effects of this
medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).
Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. Keep or take the tablet
bottle or carton with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken.
If you forget to take Biktarvy
It is important not to miss a dose of Biktarvy.
If you miss a dose:
•
If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Biktarvy, you must take the tablet as
soon as possible. Then take the next dose as usual.
•
If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Biktarvy, then do not take the
missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at your usual time.
If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Biktarvy, take another tablet. If you vomit more than 1 hour
after taking Biktarvy you do not need to take another tablet until your next regularly scheduled tablet.
Do not stop taking Biktarvy
Do not stop taking Biktarvy without talking to your doctor. Stopping Biktarvy can seriously affect
how future treatment works. If Biktarvy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you restart
taking Biktarvy tablets.
When your supply of Biktarvy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a
short time. The disease may then become harder to treat.

9S071

If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Biktarvy
treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for several months after
stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not
recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.
→

Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment,
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately
•

Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS)
and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune
system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after HIV
treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s
immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious
symptoms.

•

Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months
after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as:
muscle weakness
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity

→

If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor
immediately.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious life-threatening condition which usually starts with
flu- like symptoms. A few days later other symptoms appear including:
- Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off
- Blisters on your skin, mouth, nose, and genitals
- Red, painful, watery eyes
→
→

If you have any of these symptoms, stop your medicine immediately and tell your doctor

Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment
The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the
available data).
•

→

Bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Biktarvy may
develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to
the bone). Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol,
having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of the many risk factors
for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are:
- joint stiffness
- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder)
- difficulty with movement
If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is
partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not
listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the Yellow Card Scheme,
