were no infusion-related reactions during the previous infusion. Otherwise, continue to use instructions
indicated in the table for the Week 2 infusion rate.

Missed DARZALEX Doses
If a dose of DARZALEX is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible and adjust the dosing
schedule to maintain the dosing interval.
2.3

Recommended Concomitant Medications

Pre-infusion Medication
Administer the following pre-infusion medications 1 hour to 3 hours before every DARZALEX
infusion:
•

Corticosteroid (long- or intermediate-acting)
Monotherapy:
Administer methylprednisolone 100 mg (or equivalent) intravenously. Following the
second infusion, consider reducing the dose to 60 mg (or equivalent) administered either
orally or intravenously.
In Combination:
Administer dexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously.

6

When dexamethasone is the background regimen-specific corticosteroid, the
dexamethasone dose that is part of the background regimen will serve as pre-medication
on DARZALEX infusion days [see Clinical Studies (14)].
Do not administer background regimen-specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) on
DARZALEX infusion days when patients have received dexamethasone (or equivalent) as
a pre-medication.
•

Acetaminophen 650 mg to 1,000 mg orally

•

Diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously.

Post-infusion Medication
Administer the following post-infusion medications:
Monotherapy:
Administer methylprednisolone 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or
long-acting corticosteroid) orally for 2 days starting the day after the administration of
DARZALEX.
In Combination:
Consider administering oral methylprednisolone at a dose of less than or equal to 20 mg
(or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) beginning the day
after the administration of a DARZALEX infusion.
If a background regimen-specific corticosteroid (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone) is
administered the day after the DARZALEX infusion, additional corticosteroids may not be
needed [see Clinical Studies (14)].
For patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, consider prescribing short
and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Following the first 4 DARZALEX
infusions, consider discontinuing these additional post-infusion medications, if the patient does
not experience a major infusion-related reaction.
Prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster Reactivation
Initiate antiviral prophylaxis to prevent herpes zoster reactivation within 1 week after starting
DARZALEX and continue for 3 months following the end of treatment [see Adverse Reactions
(6.1)].

7

2.4

Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions

No dose reductions of DARZALEX are recommended. Consider withholding DARZALEX to
allow recovery of blood cell counts in the event of myelosuppression [see Warnings and
Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
For information concerning drugs given in combination with DARZALEX, see manufacturer’s
prescribing information.
Infusion-Related Reactions
For infusion-related reactions of any grade/severity, immediately interrupt the DARZALEX
infusion and manage symptoms. Management of infusion-related reactions may further require
reduction in the rate of infusion, or treatment discontinuation of DARZALEX as outlined below
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
•

Grade 1-2 (mild to moderate): Once reaction symptoms resolve, resume the infusion at no more
than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the patient does not experience any further
reaction symptoms, infusion rate escalation may resume at increments and intervals as
clinically appropriate up to the maximum rate of 200 mL/hour (Table 6).

•

Grade 3 (severe): Once reaction symptoms resolve, consider restarting the infusion at no more
than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the patient does not experience additional
symptoms, resume infusion rate escalation at increments and intervals as outlined in Table 6.
Repeat the procedure above in the event of recurrence of Grade 3 symptoms. Permanently
discontinue DARZALEX upon the third occurrence of a Grade 3 or greater infusion-related
reaction.

•

Grade 4 (life-threatening): Permanently discontinue DARZALEX.

2.5

Preparation and Administration

Preparation
DARZALEX is for single dose only.
Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique as follows:
•

Calculate the dose (mg), total volume (mL) of DARZALEX solution required and the number
of DARZALEX vials needed based on patient actual body weight.

•

DARZALEX vials of the same strength with different NDCs are available and can be admixed
in the same infusion bag [see Description (11), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

•

Check that the DARZALEX solution is colorless to pale yellow. Do not use if opaque particles,
discoloration or other foreign particles are present.

8

•

Remove a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection from the infusion bag/container that is
equal to the required volume of DARZALEX solution.

•

Withdraw the necessary amount of DARZALEX solution and dilute to the appropriate volume
by adding to the infusion bag/container containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection as
specified in Table 6 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Infusion bags/containers must be
made of either polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) or polyolefin
blend (PP+PE). Dilute under appropriate aseptic conditions. Discard any unused portion left
in the vial.

•

Gently invert the bag/container to mix the solution. Do not shake.

•

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration
prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The diluted solution may
develop very small, translucent to white proteinaceous particles, as daratumumab is a protein.
Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed.

•

If not used immediately, store the diluted solution refrigerated for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C
(36°F to 46°F) and/or at room temperature up to 15 hours at 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). The
room temperature storage includes infusion time. Protect from light during storage. Do not
freeze.

Administration
•

If stored in the refrigerator, allow the solution to come to room temperature. Administer the
diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow regulator and
with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone (PES) filter (pore
size 0.22 micrometer or 0.2 micrometer). Administration sets must be made of either
polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, PP or PE.

•

Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused product or
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

•

Do not infuse DARZALEX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.

3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
DARZALEX is a colorless to pale yellow, preservative-free solution available as:
Injection:
•

100 mg/5 mL (20 mg/mL) in a single-dose vial.

•

400 mg/20 mL (20 mg/mL) in a single-dose vial.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
DARZALEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g.
anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation [see
Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions
DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic
reactions. These reactions can be life-threatening and fatal outcomes have been reported [see
Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2,066), infusion-related reactions occurred in
37% of patients with the Week 1 (16 mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week 2 infusion, and
cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade 3/4
infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was
1.5 hours (range: 0 to 73 hours). The incidence of infusion modification due to reactions was 36%.
Median durations of 16 mg/kg infusions for the Week 1, Week 2, and subsequent infusions were
approximately 7, 4, and 3 hours respectively. Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or
within 4 hours of completing DARZALEX. Prior to the introduction of post-infusion medication
in clinical trials, infusion-related reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion.
Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension,
tachycardia, headache, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, and ocular adverse reactions,
including choroidal effusion, acute myopia, and acute angle closure glaucoma. Signs and
symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as
well as chills, vomiting and nausea. Less common signs and symptoms were wheezing, allergic
rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, hypotension, and blurred vision [see Adverse
Reactions (6.1)].
When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median
of 3.75 months (range: 2.4 to 6.9 months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX, the incidence of
infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion rate/dilution
volume used upon re-initiation was that used for the last DARZALEX infusion prior to interruption
for ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT
were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in
previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions.
In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first
16 mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days i.e. 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 2, respectively. The
incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing
infusion-related reactions on Day 1 of Week 1, 4% on Day 2 of Week 1, and 8% with subsequent
infusions. The median time to onset of a reaction was 1.8 hours (range: 0.1 to 5.4 hours). The
incidence of infusion interruptions due to reactions was 30%. Median durations of infusions were
10

4.2 hours for Week 1-Day 1, 4.2 hours for Week 1-Day 2, and 3.4 hours for the subsequent
infusions.
Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor
patients during the entire infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Interrupt DARZALEX
infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently
discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction
occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions,
reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all
patients following DARZALEX infusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Patients with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications
to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators
and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [see Dosage
and Administration (2.3)].
Ocular adverse reactions, including acute myopia and narrowing of the anterior chamber angle due
to ciliochoroidal effusions with potential for increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma, have
occurred with DARZALEX infusion. If ocular symptoms occur, interrupt DARZALEX infusion
and seek immediate ophthalmologic evaluation prior to restarting DARZALEX.
5.2

Interference with Serological Testing

Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect
Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin
test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to
RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum [see References (15)].
The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted [see Drug Interactions
(7.1)].
Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood
banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting
DARZALEX [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
5.3

Neutropenia

DARZALEX may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy [see Adverse Reactions
(6.1)].
Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s
prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of
infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils.

11

5.4

Thrombocytopenia

DARZALEX may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy [see Adverse
Reactions (6.1)].
Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s
prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX until
recovery of platelets.
5.5

Interference with Determination of Complete Response

Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum
protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of
endogenous M-protein [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. This interference can impact the
determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa
myeloma protein.
5.6

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a
pregnant woman. DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone
density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive
potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after
the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
The combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is
contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may
cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or
thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:
•

Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

•

Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

•

Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

6.1

Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of
another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
The safety data described below reflects exposure to DARZALEX (16 mg/kg) in 2,459 patients
with multiple myeloma including 2,303 patients who received DARZALEX in combination with
12

background regimens and 156 patients who received DARZALEX as monotherapy. In this pooled
safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were upper respiratory infection,
neutropenia, infusion-related reactions, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, constipation, anemia,
peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, cough, pyrexia, dyspnea, and
asthenia.
Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Ineligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
Combination Treatment with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (DRd)
The safety of DARZALEX in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was evaluated
in MAIA [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Adverse reactions described in Table 7 reflect exposure to
DARZALEX for a median treatment duration of 25.3 months (range: 0.1 to 40.44 months) for

Monotherapy
The safety of DARZALEX was evaluated in 156 adult patients with relapsed and refractory
multiple myeloma in three open-label, clinical trials. Patients received DARZALEX 16 mg/kg.
The median duration of exposure was 3.3 months (range: 0.03 to 20.04 months).
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 51 (33%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse
reactions were pneumonia (6%), general physical health deterioration (3%), and pyrexia (3%).
Adverse reactions resulted in treatment delay for 24 (15%) patients, most frequently for infections.
Adverse reactions resulted in discontinuations for 6 (4%) patients.
Adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients are presented in Table 21. Table 22

Herpes Zoster Virus Reactivation
Prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster Virus reactivation was recommended for patients in some clinical
trials of DARZALEX. In monotherapy studies, herpes zoster was reported in 3% of patients. In
27

the combination therapy studies, herpes zoster was reported in 2-5% of patients receiving
DARZALEX.
Infections
Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported as follows:
• Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 21% vs. Vd: 19%; DRd: 28% vs. Rd: 23%; DPd:
28%; DKda: 37%, Kda: 29%; DKdb: 21%
a
b

•

where carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2 was administered twice-weekly
where carfilzomib 20/70 mg/m2 was administered once-weekly

Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 23%, VMP: 15%; DRd: 32%, Rd: 23%; DVTd:
22%; VTd: 20%.

Pneumonia was the most commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection across studies. In
active controlled studies, discontinuations from treatment due to infections occurred in 1-4% of
patients.
Fatal infections (Grade 5) were reported as follows:
• Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 1%, Vd: 2%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 1%; DPd: 2%; DKd a:
5%, Kda: 3%; DKdb: 0%

Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 1%, VMP: 1%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 2%; DVTd: 0%,
VTd: 0%.

Fatal infections were generally infrequent and balanced between the DARZALEX containing
regimens and active control arms. Fatal infections were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation
Hepatitis B virus reactivation has been reported in less than 1% of patients (including fatal cases)
treated with DARZALEX in clinical trials.
Other Clinical Trials Experience
The following adverse reactions have been reported following administration of daratumumab and
hyaluronidase for subcutaneous injection:
Nervous System disorders: Syncope
6.2

Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of daratumumab.
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not
always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug
exposure.
Immune System disorders: Anaphylactic reaction, IRR (including deaths)
Gastrointestinal disorders: Pancreatitis
28

Infections: Cytomegalovirus, Listeriosis
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Effects of Daratumumab on Laboratory Tests
Interference with Indirect Antiglobulin Tests (Indirect Coombs Test)
Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including
antibody screening and cross matching. Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include
treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding [see References
(15)] or genotyping. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, supply
K-negative units after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs.
If an emergency transfusion is required, administer non-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible
RBCs per local blood bank practices.
Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests
Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE)
assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). False positive SPE
and IFE assay results may occur for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial
assessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In
patients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected,
consider using a FDA-approved daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab
from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patient’s serum, to facilitate determination of a
complete response.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The assessment of
associated risks with daratumumab products is based on the mechanism of action and data from
target antigen CD38 knockout animal models (see Data). There are no available data on the use of
DARZALEX in pregnant women to evaluate drug-associated risk of major birth defects,
miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been
conducted.
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population
is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse
outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and
miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.
The combination of DARZALEX and lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is
contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may
cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide

29

are only available through a REMS program. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or
thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.
Clinical Considerations
Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions
Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies are transferred across the placenta. Based on
its mechanism of action, DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal CD38 positive immune cells
and decreased bone density. Defer administering live vaccines to neonates and infants exposed to
DARZALEX in utero until a hematology evaluation is completed.
Data
Animal Data
Mice that were genetically modified to eliminate all CD38 expression (CD38 knockout mice) had
reduced bone density at birth that recovered by 5 months of age. Data from studies using CD38
knockout animal models also suggest the involvement of CD38 in regulating humoral immune
responses (mice), feto-maternal immune tolerance (mice), and early embryonic development
(frogs).
8.2

Lactation

Risk Summary
There is no data on the presence of daratumumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child,
or the effects on milk production. Maternal immunoglobulin G is known to be present in human
milk. Published data suggest that antibodies in breast milk do not enter the neonatal and infant
circulations in substantial amounts. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the
breastfed child when DARZALEX is administered with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or
thalidomide, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with DARZALEX. Refer to
lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information for additional information.
8.3

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific
Populations (8.1)].
Pregnancy Testing
With the combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide, refer to
the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide labeling for pregnancy testing requirements prior
to initiating treatment in females of reproductive potential.
Contraception
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with
DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose. Additionally, refer to the lenalidomide,
pomalidomide, or thalidomide labeling for additional recommendations for contraception.

30

8.4

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of DARZALEX in pediatric patients have not been established.
The safety and effectiveness of DARZALEX in combination with chemotherapy were assessed
but not established in a single open-label trial (DELPHINUS; NCT03384654) in 34 pediatric
patients (2 to <17 years of age) with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or
lymphoblastic lymphoma. No new safety signals were observed in these pediatric patients. The
pharmacokinetic parameters in these pediatric patients were within range of values previously
observed in adults with multiple myeloma given the same dose based on body weight.
8.5

Geriatric Use

Of the 2,459 patients who received DARZALEX at the recommended dose, 38% were 65 to
74 years of age, and 15% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness
were observed between these patients and younger patients. The incidence of serious adverse
reactions was higher in older than in younger patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (n=1,213), the serious adverse reactions
that occurred more frequently in patients 65 years and older were pneumonia and sepsis. Within
the DKd group in CANDOR, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients 65 years and
older compared to 6% of patients less than 65 years. Among patients with newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (n=710), the serious
adverse reaction that occurred more frequently in patients 75 years and older was pneumonia.
11 DESCRIPTION

polysorbate 20 (2 mg), sorbitol (273.3 mg), and Water for Injection, USP.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein (48 kDa) expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells,
including multiple myeloma and other cell types and tissues and has multiple functions, such as
receptor mediated adhesion, signaling, and modulation of cyclase and hydrolase activity.
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD38 and inhibits the
growth of CD38 expressing tumor cells by inducing apoptosis directly through Fc mediated cross
linking as well as by immune-mediated tumor cell lysis through complement dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). A subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells
(CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) are decreased by
daratumumab.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
NK cells express CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell lysis. Decreases in
absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells (CD16+CD56+) and activated (CD16+CD56 dim)
NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with DARZALEX treatment.
Exposure-Response Relationship
The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamics of DARZALEX have
not been fully characterized.
Cardiac Electrophysiology
DARZALEX as a large protein has a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions. There is no
evidence from non-clinical or clinical data to suggest that DARZALEX has the potential to delay
ventricular repolarization.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Daratumumab area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increases more than proportionally
over a dosage range from 1 to 24 mg/kg (0.06 to 1.5 times the approved recommended dosage) as
monotherapy or 1 to 16 mg/kg (0.06 to 1 time the approved recommended dosage) as combination
therapy.
Following administration of the approved recommended dosage of DARZALEX as monotherapy
or in combination therapy, the mean serum maximal concentration (C max) was approximately 2.7
to 3-fold higher at the end of weekly dosing compared to the first dose. The mean ± standard
deviation (SD) trough serum concentration (Cmin) at the end of weekly dosing was 573 ±
332 µg/mL when DARZALEX was administered as monotherapy and 502 ± 196 to 607 ±

32

231 µg/mL when DARZALEX was administered as combination therapy. Split dosing of the first
dose resulted in a different PK profile in the first day compared to single dosing; however, similar
Cmax and Cmin concentrations were both predicted and observed following the administration of the
second split dose on Week 1 Day 2.
When DARZALEX was administered as monotherapy, daratumumab steady state was achieved
approximately 5 months into the every 4-week dosing period (by the 21st infusion). At steady state,
daratumumab mean ± SD accumulation ratio for Cmax was 1.6 ± 0.5.
Distribution
Daratumumab volume of distribution was 4.7 ± 1.3 L as monotherapy and 4.4 ± 1.5 L as
combination therapy following administration of the approved dosage.
Elimination
Daratumumab clearance decreased with increasing dose and with multiple dosing. The mean ±
SD linear clearance was estimated to be 171.4 ± 95.3 mL/day and the mean ± SD estimated
terminal half-life associated with linear clearance was 18 ± 9 days following administration of the
approved recommended dosage of DARZALEX as monotherapy. Terminal half-life was similar
when DARZALEX was administered as combination therapy.
Specific Populations
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of daratumumab as monotherapy or
as combination therapy were observed based on sex, age (31 to 93 years), mild [total bilirubin 1
to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or aspartate aminotransaminase (AST)>ULN] and
moderate (total bilirubin 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment, or renal
impairment [Creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15-89 mL/min]. The effect of severe (total bilirubin
>3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment on daratumumab pharmacokinetics is unknown.
Body Weight
The central volume of distribution and clearance of daratumumab increased with increasing body
weight.
12.6 Immunogenicity
The observed incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA, including neutralizing antibody) is highly
dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude
meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the
incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of daratumumab or of other daratumumab
products.
With the median DARZALEX treatment ranging from 3.3 to 48 months across 10 clinical trials of
patients with multiple myeloma treated with DARZALEX as monotherapy or as combination
therapies, the incidence of anti-daratumumab antibody development was 0.6% (14/2,179) and 12
patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug
33

antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety,
and/or effectiveness of daratumumab products is unknown.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with daratumumab. No animal
studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of daratumumab on reproduction or
development, or to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
Combination Treatment with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients Ineligible for
Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
MAIA (NCT02252172), an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial, compared treatment
with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone
(DRd) to treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Lenalidomide (25 mg
once daily orally on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose oral
or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients
>75 years or body mass index [BMI] <18.5). On DARZALEX infusion days, the dexamethasone
dose was given as a pre-infusion medication. Treatment was continued in both arms until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 737 patients were randomized: 368 to the DRd arm and 369 to the Rd arm. The baseline
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The
median age was 73 (range: 45-90) years, with 44% of the patients ≥75 years of age. Fifty-two
percent (52%) of patients were male, 92% White, 4% Black or African American, and 1% Asian.
Three percent (3%) of patients reported an ethnicity of Hispanic or Latino. Thirty-four (34%) had
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0, 50% had an ECOG
performance score of 1 and 17% had an ECOG performance score of ≥2. Twenty-seven percent
had International Staging System (ISS) Stage I, 43% had ISS Stage II and 29% had ISS Stage III
disease. Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival (PFS) based on International
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.
MAIA demonstrated an improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the DRd arm as
compared to the Rd arm; the median PFS had not been reached in the DRd arm and was
31.9 months in the Rd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73; p<0.0001), representing
44% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with DRd. After a
median follow-up of 64 months, the median PFS was 61.9 months (95% CI: 54.8, NE) in the DRd
arm and 34.4 months (95% CI: 29.6, 39.2) in the Rd arm.

Combination Treatment with Bortezomib, Melphalan and Prednisone (VMP) in Patients
Ineligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
ALCYONE (NCT02195479), an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial, compared
treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone
(D-VMP), to treatment with VMP in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible
for autologous stem cell transplant. Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection
at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week
cycle (Cycle 1; 8 doses), followed by once weekly administrations at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight
more 6-week cycles (Cycles 2-9; 4 doses per cycle). Melphalan at 9 mg/m2, and prednisone at
60 mg/m2 were orally administered on Days 1 to 4 of the nine 6-week cycles (Cycles 1-9).
DARZALEX was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 706 patients were randomized: 350 to the D-VMP arm and 356 to the VMP arm. The
baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups.
The median age was 71 (range: 40-93) years, with 30% of the patients ≥75 years of age. The
majority were white (85%), female (54%), 25% had an ECOG performance score of 0, 50% had
an ECOG performance score of 1 and 25% had an ECOG performance score of 2. Nineteen percent
37

of patients had ISS Stage I, 42% had ISS Stage II and 38% had ISS Stage III disease. Efficacy was
evaluated by PFS based on IMWG criteria and overall survival (OS).
ALCYONE demonstrated an improvement in PFS in the D-VMP arm as compared to the VMP
arm (HR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.65; p<0.0001), representing a 50% reduction in the risk of disease
progression or death in patients treated with D-VMP. After a median follow-up of 40 months, the
median PFS was 36.4 months (95% CI: 32.1, 45.9) in the D-VMP arm and 19.3 months (95% CI:
18.0, 20.4) in the VMP arm.

After a median follow-up of 40 months, ALCYONE demonstrated an improvement in overall
survival (OS) in the D-VMP arm as compared to the VMP arm (HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.80;
p=0.0003), representing a 40% reduction in the risk of death in patients treated in the D-VMP arm.
Median OS had not been reached for either arm.
After a median follow-up of 87 months, the median OS was 83 months (95% CI: 72.5, NE) in the
D-VMP arm and 53.6 months (95% CI: 46.3, 60.9) in the VMP arm.

Combination Treatment with Bortezomib, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients
Eligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT)
CASSIOPEIA (NCT02541383), an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial compared
induction and consolidation treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with
bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (DVTd) to treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide
and dexamethasone (VTd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for ASCT.
The consolidation phase of treatment began a minimum of 30 days post-ASCT, when the patient
had recovered sufficiently, and engraftment was complete. The trial was limited to patients
65 years of age and younger. Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection or
intravenous (IV) injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks
(Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of repeated 28-day (4-week) induction treatment cycles (Cycles 1-4) and
two consolidation cycles (Cycles 5 and 6) following ASCT after Cycle 4. Thalidomide was
administered orally at 100 mg daily during the six bortezomib cycles. Dexamethasone (oral or
intravenous) was administered at 40 mg on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 of Cycles 1 and 2,
and at 40 mg on Days 1-2 and 20 mg on subsequent dosing days (Days 8, 9, 15, 16) of Cycles 34. Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 in Cycles 5 and 6. On the
days of DARZALEX infusion, the dexamethasone dose was administered intravenously as a preinfusion medication.
A total of 1,085 patients were randomized: 543 to the DVTd arm and 542 to the VTd arm. The
baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups.
The median age was 58 years (range: 22 to 65 years). The majority were male (59%), 48% had an
ECOG performance score of 0, 42% had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 10% had an ECOG
performance score of 2. Forty percent had ISS Stage I, 45% had ISS Stage II and 15% had ISS
Stage III disease.
Efficacy was evaluated by stringent Complete Response (sCR) rate at Day 100 post-transplant,
Complete Response Rate (CR) at Day 100 post-transplant, and Progression-Free Survival (PFS).

CASSIOPEIA demonstrated an improvement in PFS in the DVTd arm as compared to the VTd
arm; with a median follow up of 18.8 months, the median PFS had not been reached in either arm.
Treatment with DVTd resulted in a reduction in the risk of progression or death by 53% compared
to VTd alone (HR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.67; p<0.0001).

14.2 Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Combination Treatment with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone
POLLUX (NCT02076009), an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial, compared
treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose
dexamethasone (DRd) to treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in
patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. Lenalidomide (25 mg
once daily orally on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week] cycles) was given with low dose oral
or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg/week (or a reduced dose of 20 mg/week for patients
>75 years or BMI <18.5). On DARZALEX infusion days, 20 mg of the dexamethasone dose was
given as a pre-infusion medication and the remainder given the day after the infusion. For patients
on a reduced dexamethasone dose, the entire 20 mg dose was given as a DARZALEX pre-infusion
medication. Dose adjustments for lenalidomide and dexamethasone were applied according to
manufacturer’s prescribing information. Treatment was continued in both arms until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity.

41

A total of 569 patients were randomized; 286 to the DRd arm and 283 to the Rd arm. The baseline
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the DARZALEX and the control
arm. The median patient age was 65 years (range 34 to 89 years), 11% were ≥75 years, 59% were
male; 69% White, 18% Asian, and 3% African American. Patients had received a median of 1
prior line of therapy. Sixty-three percent (63%) of patients had received prior autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT). The majority of patients (86%) received a prior PI, 55% of patients had
received a prior immunomodulatory agent, including 18% of patients who had received prior
lenalidomide; and 44% of patients had received both a prior PI and immunomodulatory agent. At
baseline, 27% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment. Eighteen percent (18%) of
patients were refractory to a PI only, and 21% were refractory to bortezomib. Efficacy was
evaluated by PFS based on IMWG criteria.
POLLUX demonstrated an improvement in PFS in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm
(HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; p<0.0001), representing a 63% reduction in the risk of disease
progression or death in patients treated with DRd. After a median follow-up of 55 months, the
median PFS was 45.0 months (95% CI: 34.1, 53.9) in the DRd arm and was 17.5 months (95% CI:
13.9, 20.8) in the Rd arm.
Figure 6:

Combination Treatment with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone
CASTOR (NCT02136134), an open-label, randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 trial, compared
treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone
(DVd), to treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with multiple myeloma
who had received at least one prior therapy. Bortezomib was administered by SC injection or IV
injection at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and
43

11) of repeated 21 day (3-week) treatment cycles, for a total of 8 cycles. Dexamethasone was
administered orally at a dose of 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each of the 8
bortezomib cycles (80 mg/week for two out of three weeks of the bortezomib cycle) or a reduced
dose of 20 mg/week for patients >75 years, BMI <18.5, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or prior
intolerance to steroid therapy. On the days of DARZALEX infusion, 20 mg of the dexamethasone
dose was administered as a pre-infusion medication. For patients on a reduced dexamethasone
dose, the entire 20 mg dose was given as a DARZALEX pre-infusion medication. Bortezomib and
dexamethasone were given for 8 three-week cycles in both treatment arms; whereas DARZALEX
was given until disease progression. However, dexamethasone 20 mg was continued as a
DARZALEX pre-infusion medication in the DVd arm. Dose adjustments for bortezomib and
dexamethasone were applied according to manufacturer’s prescribing information.
A total of 498 patients were randomized; 251 to the DVd arm and 247 to the Vd arm. The baseline
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the DARZALEX and the control
arm. The median patient age was 64 years (range 30 to 88 years); 12% were ≥75 years, 57% were
male; 87% White, 5% Asian and 4% African American. Patients had received a median of 2 prior
lines of therapy and 61% of patients had received prior autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT). Sixty-nine percent (69%) of patients had received a prior PI (66% received bortezomib)
and 76% of patients received an immunomodulatory agent (42% received lenalidomide). At
baseline, 32% of patients were refractory to the last line of treatment and the proportions of patients
refractory to any specific prior therapy were in general well balanced between the treatment
groups. Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients were refractory to an immunomodulatory agent
only, with 24% patients in the DVd arm and 33% of patients in the Vd arm respectively refractory
to lenalidomide. Efficacy was evaluated by PFS based on IMWG criteria.
CASTOR demonstrated an improvement in PFS in the DVd arm as compared to the Vd arm
(HR=0.39; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.53; p<0.0001), representing a 61% reduction in the risk of disease
progression or death for patients treated with DVd versus Vd. After a median follow-up of
50 months, the median PFS was 16.7 months (95% CI: 13.1, 19.4) in the DVd arm and was
7.1 months (95% CI: 6.2, 7.7) in the Vd arm.

Combination Treatment with Twice-Weekly (20/56 mg/m2) Carfilzomib and
Dexamethasone
CANDOR (NCT03158688) was a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial which evaluated the
combination of DARZALEX with twice-weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) versus
twice-weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
myeloma who had received at least 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. Patients who had the following
46

were excluded from the trial: known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years,
known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a FEV1 <50% of predicted normal,
and active congestive heart failure. Randomization was stratified by the ISS (stage 1 or 2 vs stage
3) at screening, prior proteasome inhibitor exposure (yes vs no), number of prior lines of therapy
(1 vs ≥2), or prior cluster differentiation antigen 38 (CD38) antibody therapy (yes vs no).
DARZALEX was administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2.
Thereafter, DARZALEX was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg/kg on Days 8, 15 and
22 of Cycle 1; Days 1, 8 and 15 and 22 of Cycle 2; Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 3 to 6; and Day 1 of
each 28-day cycle until disease progression. Carfilzomib was administered intravenously at a dose
of 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2; at a dose of 56 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 8, 9, 15, and
16 ; and at a dose 56 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle thereafter.
Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 and
then 40 mg orally or intravenously on Day 22 of each 28-day cycle. For patients >75 years on a
reduced dexamethasone dose of 20 mg, the entire 20 mg dose was given as a DARZALEX preinfusion medication on days when DARZALEX was administered. Dosing of dexamethasone was
otherwise split across days when carfilzomib was administered in both study arms. Treatment was
continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A total of 466 patients were randomized; 312 to the DKd arm and 154 to the Kd arm. The baseline
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between arms. The median age was 64 years
(range 29 to 84 years), 9% were ≥75 years, 58% were male; 79% White, 14% Asian, and 2%
Black. Patients had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy and 58% of patients had received
prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The majority of patients (92%) received a prior
PI and of those 34% were refractory to PI including regimen. Fourty-two percent (42%) of patients
had received prior lenalidomide and of those, 33% were refractory to a lenalidomide containing
regimen.
Efficacy was evaluated by IRC evaluation of PFS based on the IMWG response criteria. Efficacy
results are provided in Figure 10. CANDOR demonstrated an improvement in PFS in the DKd arm
as compared to the Kd arm; the median PFS had not been reached in the DKd arm and was
15.8 months in the Kd arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.63; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.85; p=0.0014), representing
37% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for patients treated with DKd versus Kd.

Combination Treatment with Once-Weekly (20/70 mg/m2) Carfilzomib and
Dexamethasone
EQUULEUS (NCT01998971) was an open-label, multi-cohort trial which evaluated the
combination of DARZALEX with one-weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.
Patients who had the following were excluded from the trial: known moderate or severe persistent
asthma within the past 2 years, known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a
FEV1 <50% of predicted normal, or active congestive heart failure (defined as New York Heart
Association Class III-IV).
Ten patients were administered DARZALEX at a dose of 16 mg/kg intravenously on Cycle 1, Day
1 and the remaining patients were administered DARZALEX at a dose of 8 mg/kg intravenously
on Cycle 1, Days 1 and 2. Thereafter, DARZALEX was administered intravenously at a dose of
16 mg/kg on Days 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1; Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 2; Days 1 and 15 of
Cycles 3 to 6; and then Day 1 for the remaining cycles of each 28 day cycle. Carfilzomib was
administered intravenously once weekly at a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and escalated to
dose of 70 mg/m2 on Cycle 1 Days 8 and 15, and Days 1, 8, and 15 of each subsequent 28-day
cycle. In Cycles 1 and 2, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days
1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23; in cycles 3 to 6, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or
intravenously on Days 1, 2, 15 and 16 and at a dose of 40 mg on Day 8 and 22; and in cycles 7 and
thereafter, dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1 and 2 and at
a dose of 40 mg on Days 8, 15, and 22. For patients >75 years of age, dexamethasone 20 mg was
administered orally or intravenously weekly after the first week. Treatment continued until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The EQUULEUS trial enrolled 85 patients. The median patient age was 66 years (range: 38 to
85 years) with 9% of patients ≥75 years of age; 54% were male; 80% were White, 3.5% were
Black and 3.5% were Asian. Patients in the study had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy.
Seventy-three percent (73%) of patients had received prior ASCT. All patients received prior
bortezomib, and 95% of patients received prior lenalidomide. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of patients
were refractory to lenalidomide and 29% of patients were refractory to both a PI an IMiD.
Efficacy results were based on overall response rate using IMWG criteria. Efficacy results are
provided in Table 29. The median time to response was 0.95 months (range: 0.9, 14.3). The median
duration of response was 28 months (95% CI: 20.5, not estimable).

Combination Treatment with Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone
EQUULEUS (NCT01998971) was an open-label trial in which 103 patients with multiple
myeloma who had received a prior PI and an immunomodulatory agent, received 16 mg/kg
DARZALEX in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone until disease
progression. Pomalidomide (4 mg once daily orally on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day [4-week]
cycles) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg/week (reduced dose of
20 mg/week for patients >75 years or BMI <18.5). On DARZALEX infusion days, 20 mg of the
dexamethasone dose was given as a pre-infusion medication and the remainder given the day after
the infusion. For patients on a reduced dexamethasone dose, the entire 20 mg dose was given as a
DARZALEX pre-infusion medication.
The median patient age was 64 years (range: 35 to 86 years) with 8% of patients ≥75 years of age.
Patients in the study had received a median of 4 prior lines of therapy. Seventy-four percent (74%)
of patients had received prior ASCT. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of patients received prior
bortezomib treatment, and 33% of patients received prior carfilzomib. All patients received prior
lenalidomide treatment, with 98% of patients previously treated with the combination of
bortezomib and lenalidomide. Eighty nine percent (89%) of patients were refractory to
lenalidomide and 71% refractory to bortezomib; 64% of patients were refractory to bortezomib
and lenalidomide.
Efficacy results were based on overall response rate as determined by Independent Review
Committee using IMWG criteria (see Table 30).

The median time to response was 1 month (range: 0.9 to 2.8 months). The median duration of
response was 13.6 months (range: 0.9+ to 14.6+ months).
Monotherapy
SIRIUS (NCT01985126), was an open-label trial evaluating DARZALEX monotherapy in
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 3 prior lines of
therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent or who were doublerefractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. In 106 patients,
DARZALEX 16 mg/kg was administered with pre- and post-infusion medication. Treatment
continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
The median patient age was 63.5 years (range: 31 to 84 years), 49% were male and 79% were
White. Patients had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy. Eighty percent of patients had
received prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Prior therapies included bortezomib
(99%), lenalidomide (99%), pomalidomide (63%) and carfilzomib (50%). At baseline, 97% of
patients were refractory to the last line of treatment, 95% were refractory to both, a proteasome
inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulatory agent, and 77% were refractory to alkylating agents.
Efficacy results were based on overall response rate as determined by the Independent Review
Committee assessment using IMWG criteria (see Table 31).

PATIENT INFORMATION
DARZALEX® (Dar'-zah-lex)
(daratumumab)
injection, for intravenous use
DARZALEX may be used with other medicines called lenalidomide, thalidomide or pomalidomide. You should also read
the Medication Guide that comes with lenalidomide, thalidomide or pomalidomide if you use DARZALEX with
these medicines.
What is DARZALEX?
DARZALEX is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with multiple myeloma:
• in combination with the medicines lenalidomide and dexamethasone in people with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma who cannot receive a type of stem cell transplant that uses their own stem cells (autologous stem cell
transplant) and in people whose multiple myeloma has come back or did not respond to treatment who have
received at least one prior medicine to treat multiple myeloma.
• in combination with the medicines bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone, in people with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma who cannot receive a type of stem cell transplant that uses their own stem cells (autologous stem cell
transplant).
• in combination with the medicines bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed people who
are eligible to receive a type of stem cell transplant that uses their own stem cells (autologous stem cell transplant).
• in combination with the medicines bortezomib and dexamethasone, in people who have received at least one prior
medicine to treat multiple myeloma.
• in combination with the medicines carfilzomib and dexamethasone, in people whose multiple myeloma has come
back or did not respond to treatment who have received one to three prior medicines to treat multiple myeloma.
• in combination with the medicines pomalidomide and dexamethasone in people who have received at least two
prior medicines to treat multiple myeloma, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.
• alone in people who have received at least three prior medicines, including a proteasome inhibitor and an
immunomodulatory agent, or did not respond to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.
It is not known if DARZALEX is safe and effective in children.
Do not receive DARZALEX:
if you have a history of a severe allergic reaction to daratumumab or any of the ingredients in DARZALEX. See the
end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in DARZALEX.
Before you receive DARZALEX, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if
you:
• have a history of breathing problems.
• have had shingles (herpes zoster).
• have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection as DARZALEX could cause hepatitis B virus to become
active again. Your healthcare provider will check you for signs of this infection before, during and for some time
after treatment with DARZALEX. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get worsening tiredness or
yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes.
• have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). DARZALEX contains sorbitol. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. People
with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.
• are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. DARZALEX may harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider
right away if you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant during treatment with DARZALEX.
o Females who are able to become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control (contraception)
during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose of DARZALEX. Talk to your healthcare provider about
birth control methods that you can use during this time.
o Before starting DARZALEX in combination with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide, females and
males must agree to the instructions in the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide REMS program.
▪ The lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide REMS has more information about effective methods of
birth control, pregnancy testing, and blood donation for females who can become pregnant.
▪ For males who have female partners who can become pregnant, there is information in the lenalidomide,
pomalidomide, and thalidomide REMS about sperm donation and how lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and
thalidomide can pass into human semen.
• are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if DARZALEX passes into your breast milk. You should not
breastfeed during treatment with DARZALEX. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your
baby during treatment with DARZALEX.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter
medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
How will I receive DARZALEX?
1

•
•
•
•

DARZALEX may be given alone or together with other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma.
DARZALEX will be given to you by your healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion into your vein.
Your healthcare provider will decide the time between doses as well as how many treatments you will receive.
Your healthcare provider will give you medicines before each dose of DARZALEX and after each dose of
DARZALEX to help reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions.
If you miss any appointments, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule your appointment.
What are the possible side effects of DARZALEX?
DARZALEX may cause serious reactions, including:
• Infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions are common with DARZALEX. Serious allergic reactions
and reactions due to release of certain substances by your body (systemic) that can lead to death, can happen with
DARZALEX. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop your infusion or completely stop treatment with
DARZALEX if you have infusion-related reactions. Get medical help right away if you get any of the following
symptoms:
o shortness of breath or trouble breathing
o throat tightness or
o nausea
o dizziness or lightheadedness
irritation
o vomiting
(hypotension)
o runny or stuffy nose
o chills
o cough
o headache
o fever
o wheezing
o itching
o chest discomfort
o heart beating faster than usual
o high blood pressure
o blurred vision
o low oxygen in the blood (hypoxia)
o eye pain

•

Changes in blood tests. DARZALEX can affect the results of blood tests to match your blood type. These
changes can last for up to 6 months after your final dose of DARZALEX. Your healthcare provider will do blood
tests to match your blood type before you start treatment with DARZALEX. Tell all of your healthcare providers
that you are being treated with DARZALEX before receiving blood transfusions.

•

Decreases in blood cell counts. DARZALEX can decrease white blood cell counts which help fight infections and
blood cells called platelets which help to clot blood. Decreases in blood cell counts are common with DARZALEX,
but can be severe. Your healthcare provider will check your blood cell counts during treatment with DARZALEX.
Tell your healthcare provider if you develop fever or have signs of bruising or bleeding.

The most common side effects of DARZALEX include:
• cold-like symptoms
• nerve damage causing tingling,
• cough
(upper respiratory
numbness or pain
• fever
infection)
• tiredness
• shortness of breath
• diarrhea
• swollen hands, ankles, or feet
• feeling weak
• constipation
• nausea
• decreased red blood
cells
These are not all the possible side effects of DARZALEX.
Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
General information about the safe and effective use of DARZALEX.
